# Multi-Process-Threads-Manager-with-IPC-and-Parallel-Text-File-Processing
# Project Overview & Implementations

For this project, I developed a comprehensive operating system simulation project. This endeavor aims to bridge theoretical knowledge with practical skills in managing processes and threads, implementing inter-process communication (IPC), and exploring parallel computing concepts. The key facets of this project include:

- **Multi-Process and Thread Management**: I built a system capable of managing multiple processes and threads. This component allows for a granular view of system resource utilization, displaying intricate details such as process IDs, thread statuses, and associated Light-Weight Processes (LWPs).
  
- **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**: The project simulates IPC through two main mechanisms: shared memory and message passing. This simulation is conducted both within and across processes and threads, offering a deep dive into the nuances of process communication.
  
- **Parallel Text File Processing**: A significant part of the project is devoted to the parallel processing of text files. This system efficiently handles character transformation and frequency counting tasks by leveraging multiple threads or processes. The design focuses on minimizing execution time while maximizing resource utilization.
